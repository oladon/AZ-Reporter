This repository contains one file, az_reporter.pl, which connects to the 
AgileZen API and pulls down all the data on a project. It then creates some 
hashes with various statistics about the cards and work, aggregating the 
data as it goes.

The variables in the ### User configuration ### section are explained below.

$apikey -- This is the API key you generate from within your AgileZen account.

$projectid -- This is your project's numeric ID. You can extract it from your 
              logged-in URL (i.e. https://agilezen.com/project/<id>)

$url -- This probably won't need changing, unless AgileZen changes it on their 
        end; it's the entire URL the script uses to get the data via the API.

$outputdir -- Any files created/modified by the script will be in this dir.

%ignored_phases -- Any keys with values of 1 will not be included in any of 
                   the script's aggregated data.

%ignored_statuses -- Similar to ignored_phases, but with statuses. Statuses at 
                     time of writing are: planned, started, ready, blocked, 
                     and finished

%ignored_steps -- similar to the previous two. Steps at time of writing are: 
                  backlog, working, ready, blocked, and archive

%reports -- This hash contains all the reports that can be run using this 
            script (right now just two). New reports can be added as elements 
            of this hash, and should include a "code" key which points to the 
            subroutine to use as the aggregation code for the report.

%tag_groups -- You can define as many tag groups as you like; the script will 
               run each group's reports separately. The colors will correspond 
               to the statuses or steps in the graph (if used). The "colors" 
               value in %tag_groups will override that in %reports, if present.
